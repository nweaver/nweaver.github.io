The MSN messenger worm just reported is not a "Warhol Worm", it is a
topologically aware trojan worm, like a mail worm, albeit using MSN
messenger to send out a pointer to a trojan URL, instead of using email.

<H4 ALIGN="Center">Abstract</H4>

<P>It is well known that active worms such as Code Red and the Morris
internet worm have the potential to spread very quickly, on the order
of hours to days.  But it is possible to construct hyper-virulent
active worms, capable of infecting all vulnerable hosts in
approximately 15 minutes to an hour.  Such "Warhol Worms", by using
optimized scanning routines, hitlist scanning for initial propagation,
and permutation scanning for complete, self coordinated coverage,
could cause maximum damage before people could respond.  The potential
mayhem is staggering.

<P>This is a completely new version, posted on august 15th, 2001.  The
original essay is still available <A HREF="warhol.old.html">here</A>.

<H4 ALIGN="Center">Introduction</H4>

<P>Active worms, programs which replicate themselves by attacking
servers on network connected machines, have been a problem for many
years.  In the decade since the Morris worm, several low grade, low
publicity, generally benign worms have propagated.  Code Red was
simply more of the same, albeit with more press.  It is also well
known that worms could be much more malicious then have been currently
seen.

<P>But one question remaining is how fast a malicious active worm
could spread.  Previous active worms have required several hours to
spread effectively, which gives sufficient time for people to
recognize the threat and limit the potential damage.  Since a
malicious worm would wish to do as much damage as possible, the worm
can be much more devastating if it spreads quickly.  A world wide
infection time of under an hour would be particularly destructive.

<P>In general, the speed of a worm's spread is dictated by the
efficiency of finding new targets.  Apart from optimizing the scanning
code, a couple of minor variations in scan sequence can result in
significant improvements in speed.  The greatest benefit is from
hitlist scanning: using a precompiled target list during the initial
spread.  Further benefit can come from permutation scanning and
variants, which use a pseudo random permutation create a self
coordinating but seemingly random scan.  The result would be a "Warhol
Worm", able to infect most or all vulnerable machines in the first 15
minutes of release.

<H4 ALIGN="Center">Active Worms</H4>

<P>An active worm, unlike the slightly more common mail worm, needs no
human interaction to spread.  It starts out on a single host and scans
for other vulnerable machines on the Internet.  When the scan finds a
machine which the worm can potentially infect, it sends out a probe to
infect the target.  If successful, the worm transfers over a copy of
itself to the new host, which begins running the worm.

<P>The main factor which limits how fast an active worm can spread is
how fast new targets can be discovered, how many potential targets are
available, and how fast they can be infected.  Fewer targets will
cause a worm to slow down, because any given scan is less likely to
find a valid target.  The time it takes to infect a target slows a
worm slightly, by limiting the rate at which new worms come online.

<P>In most cases, the biggest limitation is the rate at which a worm
can scan the network.  Although a single scan may take anywhere from a
few milliseconds (for a local host) to a second or longer (for a remote
machine), a multithreaded worm can easily scan in parallel.  A
properly constructed scanner should be able to have many scans
outstanding, even using a TCP-like back off strategy to insure
that it is scanning at the maximum possible rate.  A good goal for a
Warhol Worm would be 100 scans per second, an easily achievable rate.

<P>It is also important to separate out the act of scanning and
probing by only probing machines which the scan suggests are actually
vulnerable.  Code Red was indiscriminate in its probing, thus it tried
to infect many non-vulnerable web servers.  This has two negative
effects: it told the recipient machine that it was running the worm
(resulting in several anti Code Red web pages) and it slowed down the
rate of infection, since such probes are a significant waste of
effort.  Similarly, a worm should never try to infect a machine which
is already running a copy of the worm.

<P>Even very fast active worms only have minor effects on the network.
Since the worm itself can be small (100k is a reasonable size), a
probe to attempt an infection is smaller (5k or so), and the scan
itself is miniscule (a few dozen bytes may be sufficient), the actual
bandwidth requirements are surprisingly low.  This is in marked
contrast to mail worms, which have to send out copies of themselves in
order to attempt to infect a host.

<P>The only significant network effect is a marked increase in BGP
(routing related) requests, as the scanning worms keep trying to probe
different machines throughout the world.  This should have little
effect on backbone routers, but Code Red did <A
HREF="http://www.renesys.com/projects/bgp_instability/">demonstrate
effects on some routers near the periphery and did cause some
instablities</A>.  There are scanning mechanisms (discussed later)
which would not demonstrate these effects.

<H4 ALIGN="Center">Existing Infection Strategies</H4>

<P>Most worms have used random scanning in order to detect new
targets.  The worm picks a random IP address, scans it to see if it is
vulnerable, and then attempts an infection.  Random scanning has some
very good properties: it results in the worm scattering itself quickly
through the network and the scans themselves seem to come from
everywhere.  Unfortunately, this begins to saturate out after a while
as fewer random probes reveal potential targets.  

<P>A fully coordinated worm, where the worms explicitly coordinate their
attack on the network, is a theoretical possibility but has not been
seen in practice due to the difficulty in coding and coordinating the
worms.

<P>Linear scanning, where the worm scans a linear address range and
partitions this range between itself and any newly infected machine,
is a strategy which is not seen in practice.  It lacks the good
initial scattering of random scanning and an intelligent firewall
should immediately detect and halt linear scans.

<P>Finally, virulent worms often start by scanning the local subnet
and logically adjacent networks for new victims.  This is a very
effective for infecting nearby machines, since vulnerable machines are
often clustered together and this proves an excellent way to wreak
havoc in internal networks.  Code Red II's increased virulence was
mostly caused by the included subnet scanning routines.

<H4 ALIGN="Center">New Infection Strategies</H4>

<P>One of the biggest problems a worm faces is getting a significant
initial population.  Although a worm spreads exponentially during the
early stages of infection, the time needed to infect the first 10,000
hosts dominates the infection time.

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG

ALT="Caida.org's code red graph"> <P ALIGN="CENTER"><B>Figure 1:</B>
<A HREF="http://www.caida.org/analysis/security/code-red/">David
Moore's graph of the initial spread of the Code Red Worm, from
Caida.org</A></P>

<P>There is a simple way for a Warhol worm to overcome this problem:
Hitlist scanning.  Long before the worm is released, the worm author
collects a list of 10,000 to 50,000 potentially vulnerable machines
with good network connections.  The worm, when released onto an
initial machine on this hitlist, begins scanning down the list.  When
it infects a machine, it divides the hitlist in half, communicating
half to the recipient worm, keeping the other half.

<P>This quick division insures that even if only 10-20% of the
machines on the hitlist are actually vulnerable, a Warhol worm will go
through the hitlist and establish itself on all vulnerable machines in
under a minute.  And although the hitlist may start at 200 kilobytes,
it quickly shrinks to nothing during the partitioning.  This provides
a great benefit in constructing a Warhol Worm by speeding the initial
infection.  The hitlist should ideally consist of potential targets
with good network connections and specific commercial interest.


<P ALIGN="center"><IMG SRC="hitlist.gif" ALIGN="center" ALT="Effects of hitlist scanning graph"></P>

<P ALIGN="center"><B>Figure 2:</B> Simulated infection rates for
Random scanning with a hitlist able to compromise 10,000 machines
verses one which starts on 10 machines.  The lines end when 99% of the
1M vulnerable machines are infected.</P>

<P>Constructing the hitlist is easy.  Since the hitlist is constructed
long before a worm is released, a slow scan would not be noticed.  The
<A HREF="http://project.honeynet.org">Honeynet project</A> has shown
that scans occur at alarming frequencies, thus another one could be
conducted without people correlating it with the later worm release.
Since such a scan is just to determine what service a machine is
running, not whether the targeted hole exists, it could be completed
even before an exploit for the worm is developed.  Finally, public
servers such as the <A HREF="http://www.netcraft.com">Netcraft Survey</A>
could be used to generate the hitlist for some services, without
requiring a scan.

<P>Although random scanning works well initially, it begins to die out
after the number of uninfected hosts goes down.  This die down can be
reduced through the use of permutation scanning.  In a permutation
scan, an already infected machine responds differently than a
potential target, as a way of telling the scanning worm that the
machine is infected.  Not only does this prevent needless
reinfections, but it can be used to impose coordination on the worm.

<P>In a permutation scan, all worms share a common pseudo random
permutation of the IP address space.  Such a permutation can be
efficiently generated using any block cipher of 32 bits with a
preselected key: simply encrypt an index to get the corresponding
address in the permutation, and decrypt an address to get its index.

<P>Worms infected during the hitlist phase or local subnet scanning
start just after their point in the permutation and scan through the
permutation, looking for vulnerable machines.  Whenever it sees an
already infected machine, it chooses a new, random start point and
proceeds from there.  Worms infected by permutation scanning would
start at a random point.

<P>This has the effect of providing a semi coordinated, comprehensive
scan while maintaining the benefits of random probing.  Each worm
looks like it is conducting a random scan, but it attempts to minimize
duplication of effort.  This keeps the infection rate higher and
guarantees an eventual comprehensive scan.

<P>Additionally, the worms could be programmed to comprehensively
rescan the net at regular intervals.  A timer could induce the worms
to wake up and rescan the section of the next permutation in a
sequence, starting at itself and ending at the next worm.  This would
cause every address to be completely rescanned at regular, predictable
intervals, detecting any machines which come onto the network.

<P>A further optimization is a partitioned permutation scan.  In this
scheme, the worm has a range of the permutation that it is initially
responsible for.  When it infects another machine, it reduces its
range in half with the newly infected worm taking the other section.
When the range gets below a certain level, it switches to simple
permutation scanning and otherwise behaves like a permutation scan.
It offers a slight but noticeable increase in scanning efficiency.

<P ALIGN="center"><B>Figure 3:</B> Simulated infection rates for
Random, Permutation, and Partitioned Permutation scanning.  The lines
end when complete infection of all 1M vulnerable machines is achieved.
All infections started with an initial population of 10,000 acquired
by the hitlist scan.</P>

<P>Finally, if a worm detects that it's internet-wide scanning is
being ARP limited, it could switch to subnet permutation scanning.  In
this case, a different permutation is used to generate the upper 24
bits of the address, with the lower 8 bits scanned in a sequential
order for each entry.  The worms, upon being scanned, give enough
information to determine what scanning mechanism was used to infect
itself, and what scanning mechanism it is using, so the other worms
know how to respond and whether they should skip to a new location.

<P>Subnet permutation scanning is a poor choice when the worm is not
ARP limited, because the linear scans are easily detected and blocked
by intelligent firewalls, so it should only be used as a fallback
mechanism when the scan rate has dropped below a threshold and the
shift of modes results in a significant speedup in the scan rate.

<H4 ALIGN="Center">Infection Simulator</H4>

<P>A simple simulator was constructed for evaluating the virulence of
such worms.  It used a separate permutation to map between a 32 bit
address space and a number of potential machines.  Every timestep,
each active worm is evaluated.  Parameters include the number of
vulnerable machines, the size of the initial population, the number of
scans per second, and the time it takes to infect a machine.  

<P>Results suggest that, for 1,000,000 vulnerable machines and a
starting population of 10,000 from the hitlist scan, 1 minute to
process the hitlist, 100 scans per second, and 1 second to infect a
machine, complete infection will occur in roughly 8 minutes, with 99%
infection occurring in 6 minutes and 30 seconds.  A much slower scan
rate of 10 scans per second requires 50 minutes to reach the 99% mark,
and slightly over an hour for complete infection.

<P>A lower number of vulnerable hosts will naturally slow the rate of
infection.  Thus, if the number of vulnerable hosts is reduced to
250,000, the time is increased to a little over 20 minutes for complete
infection at 100 scans/second.  

<P>The source code for simulating <A HREF="warhol.c">permutation
scans</A>, <A HREF="division.c">partitioned permutation scans</A>, and
<A HREF="random.c">random scans</A> is included.  6 round, 32 bit RC5
was used for all permutations and PRNG purposes.  The parameter for
the number of outstanding infections per worm is ignored, as it would
only affect the speed of hitlist scanning.

<H4 ALIGN="Center">Potential Targets and Multimode Worms</H4>

<P>There are three very good targets for active worms to exploit:
Microsoft IIS, Microsoft Exchange, and the various P2P and messenger
programs.  A newly discovered exploit in any of these applications
would enable a highly virulent worm.  But although a single exploit
can provide for an effective worm, a worm which exploits multiple
services and multiple holes would spread farther, able to affect more
machines in a single attack.

<P>Microsoft IIS is an amazingly vulnerable target, even in the
aftermath of Code Red I and II.  IIS is installed by default with
Windows 2000 server and it provides a highly homogenious target.
Furthermore, there is a continued negligence when it comes to
maintaining patches, even on the part of Microsoft.  The response
following the initial breakout of Code Red demonstrated this clearly:
a week after the first outbreak, the second outbreak corrupted nearly
as many machines.

<P>Microsoft Exchange is less prevalent than IIS, but it makes for a
highly attractive second target for a multimode worm.  Since email needs
to get into the corporation, this provides an excellent route for a
worm to cut through firewalls.  Once inside a firewall, a worm can
cause considerable havoc since many internal networks are insecure.

<P>Finally, holes in the current generation of messenger applications
(AOL IM, MSN messenger) and peer to peer file sharing programs
(Napster, Kazaa) make for excellent targets for worms.  Although most
machines running these programs have comparatively poor network
connections, these applications have a great advantage for spreading a
worm: Each machine already has information about other machines
running the program.

<P>Hitlist scanning isn't necessary for a worm attacking a peer to
peer application, the worm simply propagates using the information
built into the protocol and application before switching to subnet and
permutation scanning as a way of shortcutting gaps and disconnects in
the peer to peer structure.  Windows XP will undoubtedly make this
attack especially effective with its bundled messenger application.

<P>The only problem with P2P applications is that they are kept
updated by the users as older versions can't connect.  Thus, a worm
which attacks a P2P application will need to use an unpublished
exploit.


<H4 ALIGN="Center">Potential Defenses</H4>

<P>The most effective defenses: security by design, sensible defaults,
and a diversity of targets, seem unlikely to happen until after a
devastating worm is released.  Although buffer overflow attacks have
been understood for 2 decades, network services are still written in
type-unsafe, bounds-unsafe languages.  Security audits seem alien to
developers while sensible defaults seem to be a myth.  Until a major,
highly damaging outbreak occurs, followed by the inevitable billion
dollar lawsuits, software companies will probably continue their bad
practices.

<P>Similarly, the Microsoft trend to use its monopoly powers to grow
into new markets and force out competition has the side effect of
producing homogeneous populations of computers.  Homogeneous
populations, whether in potatoes or computers, are always more
vulnerable to diseases.

<P>Although counter worms seem like an attractive idea, they offer
effectively no benefit.  They require a patch to work and can only be
used to inoculate, since a malicious worm can easily disable the
route it used to infect a machine.  Thus they offer no benefits over
a good auto updater.  To make matters worse, the author of a "white
worm" would face the same threat of prosecution that a malicious worm
writer would face.

<P>A faster transition to IPv6 would prevent random and permutation
scans from working as the address space is too large.  But this
doesn't prevent worms from using structure based scanning and which
take advantage of other mechanisms.  It would raise the bar slightly,
but not sufficiently to prevent high speed worms from being written.

<P>Probably the best current defense against a Warhol Worm is context
sensitive firewalls, which only allow traffic which corresponds to
tightly defined models, internal firewalls throughout the corporate
network, and regular security examinations.  The general philosophy
should be one of "That which is not explicitly allowed is forbidden"
when designing both the network and the firewall rules.  Regular
backups are also essential.

<H4 ALIGN="Center">A Worst Case Warhol Worm</H4>

<P>A worst case Warhol Worm is truly frightening, capable of doing
many billions of dollars in real damage and disruption.  Since it can
achieve complete spread in well under an hour, and could begin doing
damage immediately on infecting a machine, human mediated responses
offer almost no hope of stopping it.

<P>A malicious Warhol Worm would ideally use an unknown exploit but
one which is generally unpatched would be sufficient.  The ideal case
for maximizing damage would be a multimode worm which infects both
IIS and Exchange.  IIS is used to spread the worm quickly, while
Exchange is used as the primary means of crossing corporate firewalls.

<P>The worm spreads very quickly, by hitlist scanning followed by
local subnet, nearby subnet, and permutation scanning.  If a
particular copy of the worm finds its scanning is too slow and ARP
limited, it falls back to partitioned subnet scanning.  Such a worm
could easily spread worldwide in the required 15 minutes, as well as
quickly infesting any internal corporate networks it can reach.

<P>In addition, the worm could also act like a low volume mail worm.
Instead of being a primary mode of spreading, it is simply a secondary
mode: an additional attempt to breach key corporate firewalls during
the initial minutes of infection.  The mail worm component is simply a
very small trojan which tries to connect back to the infecting worm to
transfer the rest of the worm by HTTP.  It is important that any mail
worm component not generate significant network traffic, so it only
attempts to mail to addresses the worm discovers within major
corporate and government targets.

<P>The malicious payload is activated as soon as a machine is
infected.  This payload is highly devastating but constructed to not
slow the worm's spread.  If possible, it immediately installs hooks so
that it will start again if the machine is reset.  Another installed
startup program attempts to reflash the bios.

<P>It then overwrites random pieces of non system files.  Although
this is slower than simply deleting files, it is harder to recover.
At the same time, it changes modification times to mask which files
are corrupted.  It also searches the local network neighborhood,
attempting to overwrite sections of all files it can mount remotely.
As long as it continues running, it keeps adding corruptions.  Instead
of overwriting executables, however, it infects them with copies of
itself.

<P>If an exchange server is infected, it places a copy of the payload
in all user's mailboxes and notifies them that they have new mail.
With luck, during the first few minutes of infection, a number of users
will open and run the malicious payload.  The odds of this happening
would be improved if the worm was released during a weekday.

<P>Another optimization would be for the worm to start behaving as a
much more active mail worm after a couple of hours.  Although mail
worms are less effective, and produce greater system load, it does
provide a good mechanism to reach more users.

<P>After a couple hours from initial infection, the worms can then
begin DDOSing major sites.  Windows update and other patch sources are
excellent targets, as are the antivirus vendors.

<P>Finally, the worms can produce a coordinated, interval rescan of
the net.  During permutation scanning, if the worm sees several
infected machines without finding a new target, it knows that the odds
of finding more machines is low, so it could stop scanning.  But at a
regular interval from the moment of initial infection, the next
permutation in the sequence could be generated.  If the worm then
scans from itself to the next infected machine, this creates a
coordinated, efficient rescan of the address space.

<P>As a last optimization, the worm could support cryptographically
signed, loadable modules.  Each rescan of the network will reveal the
location of 2 other worms, the worm which it ends on and the worm
which ended on it.  If these are recorded, the worm can keep a list of
other infected machines.  Then, when a new code module is introduced,
it can be quickly spread from worm to worm, to be transmitted through
the entire worm network.

<P>This doesn't make sense for adding local malicious modules to the
worm, as such worms spread so fast that highly malicious code can be
packaged with the worm itself.  But it does allow the worm to quickly
be modified to use new exploits: allowing the reinfection to forgoe
hitlist scanning, and simply explode from the base of still active
worms.  This also can be used as a launching ground for DDOS attacks,
providing a large number of potential zombies.



<H4 ALIGN="Center">Conclusions</H4>

<P>Malicious worms are a serious threat to our homogenous, highly
connected networks.  Even the largely benign, comparatively slow worms
like Code Red and SirCam have caused some disruption.  But the
potential is far worse: spreading faster than humans can respond and
leaving a wake of damaged data and corrupted machines.  By the time
people understand what was happening, all damage would be done.

<P>Optimized scanning routines, hitlist scanning, and permutation
scanning can be combined to produce hyper virulent Warhol Worms.
Since they are so fast, such worms would be the vehicle of choice for
delivering malicious payloads to the net at large.


<H4 ALIGN="Center">Acknowledgments</H4>

Thanks to Michael Constant for helping develop the Hitlist scanning
concept, Jon Kuroda, Jim Ausman, and David Wagner for additional
suggestions and assistance.  Stuart Staniford has pointed out that, if
one generates a hitlist for the entire network, and one compresses the
hitlist for transfering, the hitlist propigation could flash over the
entire network in a minute or two.

<H3 ALIGN="center">Why I'm keeping this page up!</H3>

<P>Unfortunately, the results are too simple: Any reasonably
intelligent programmer who thinks about the problem will come up with
a similar solution, or a coordinated worm which efficiently divides
the search space.  Coordinated worms are even faster but do require a
level of worm to worm communication.  The point of this was to just
demonstrate that coordinated worms are NOT a prerequisite for truly
fast propagation.

<P>Secondly, the current worms, taking 12 hours to a day, are still fast
enough to foil most human reaction: Look at the continued spread of
the code red variants, roughly 3 weeks after initial infection.
Changing this to under an hour would only slightly increase the reach
in the current environment.

<P>Finally, I am a personal believer in the doctrine of full
disclosure, especially when the "bad guys" (skilled, malicious
programmers) could easily come up with the same results without
documentation.  It is important for the rest of us to consider and
evaluate what the realistic threat is.  Saying nothing would help
nobody.

<P>We have always known, even before the Morris worm, that connected,
homogeneous computer networks are vulnerable to fast moving, active
worms.  This, however, is an important result because it is a reminder
of just HOW vulnerable it is.  Human mediated defenses can not stop a
fast active worm.
