## Putting the Science in Mad Science

Welcome to Skerry Technologies, my (currently one-man) Research and
Development operation focused on small Unmanned Aerial Systems.

Nicholas Weaver obtained his Ph.D. from the University of California
at Berkeley in 2003.  His primary research focus is on digital,
explainable, and commonly adversarial systems.

Within that, however, is a huge range of topics.  Down at the lowest
level he's designed his own custom boards and an FPGA architecture,
while the high level has ranged up to sophisticated network
measurement techniques and economic disruption of nefarious actors.

When it comes to UAS systems his primary focus is on hardware/software
co-design to enable autonomous operation.  He's developed an autopilot
that can mate a Raspberry Pi compute module to an ardupilot-based
autopilot and is now working on developing his own from-scratch
autopilot based on co-designed software and hardware.

His CV is [available here](cv) and his nontechnical writing is mostly
