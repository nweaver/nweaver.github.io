## Putting the *Science* in Mad Science

Welcome to Skerry Technologies, my (currently one-man) Research and
Development operation focused on small Unmanned Aerial Systems.
Although, in all honesty, it more like "mad engineering" rather than
mad science.

I obtained his Ph.D. from the University of California
at Berkeley in 2003.  My primary research focus is on digital,
explainable, and commonly adversarial systems.

Within that, however, is a huge range of topics.  Down at the lowest
level i've designed my own custom boards and an FPGA architecture,
while the high level has ranged up to sophisticated network
measurement techniques and economic disruption of nefarious actors.

When it comes to UAS systems my primary focus is on hardware/software
co-design to enable autonomous operation.  I've developed an autopilot
that can mate a Raspberry Pi compute module to an ardupilot-based
autopilot as a proof of concept and I am now working on developing my
own from-scratch autopilot based on co-designed software and hardware.
